## 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on DevOps enthusiast exploring cloud infrastructure, automation, and full-stack deployment.  
I believe in **learning by building**, and my GitHub is where I document my progress through real-world projects and tools.

I'm currently building projects using AWS, Terraform, Node.js, MongoDB, and more — with a strong focus on applying DevOps best practices, not just studying them.
