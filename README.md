# 👋 Hello, I'm Yash Dive

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently pursuing my **BBA in Computer Applications (BBA CA)**, with a strong focus on learning **Linux**, **DevOps**, and **Python**. I am passionate about technology and excited to explore new tools and practices in software development and IT infrastructure.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **self-motivated learner**, always eager to expand my skill set and dive deeper into new technologies. Although I'm still in the process of learning and gaining hands-on experience, I am committed to building a solid foundation in **Linux system administration**, **DevOps engineering**, and **cloud technologies**.

I believe in learning by doing, and I use GitHub to showcase my personal projects, coding exercises, and progress in mastering new technologies.

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

- **Linux** and **Linux System Administration** (Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat)
- **DevOps** tools and practices (CI/CD, Docker, Jenkins)
- **Python** programming language (Basic to intermediate level)
- **Cloud technologies** (Getting familiar with AWS, GCP)
- **Automation** with **Bash** and **Python** scripts
- **Version Control** using **Git** and **GitHub**

## 💡 My Learning Goals

- Build expertise in **DevOps** practices, including automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- Master containerization with **Docker** and learn **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- Gain proficiency in **Python** for backend development and scripting.
- Explore **cloud computing** and **infrastructure as code (IaC)** using tools like **Terraform** and **Ansible**.

## 🛠️ Skills (Currently Developing)

- **Linux**: Installation, configuration, and basic system administration tasks.
- **Python**: Writing scripts and building basic programs for automation.
- **Docker**: Containerizing applications and learning container orchestration.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control, branching, and contributing to open-source projects.
- **CI/CD**: Setting up simple pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
